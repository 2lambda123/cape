Description

CAPE is software to improve Computational Aerosciences Productivity &
Execution.

CAPE has two main purposes:

1. To execute and post-process three different CFD solvers:

    A. Cart3D
    B. FUN3D
    C. OVERFLOW

2. Create and use "datakits" a combination of database and toolkit. These are
   data structures particularly well-suited to databases created from
   aerosciences data.

Installation
--------------

The simplest method to install CAPE is to use ``pip`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/nasa/cape.git#egg=cape

**Notes**:

    1.  On Windows (where CAPE might be of limited use), replace ``python3``
        with ``py``
    2.
