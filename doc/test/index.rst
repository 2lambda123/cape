===================
CAPE Testing Suite
===================

Tests for many of the features have the primary purpose of making sure that new
features do not interfere with core capabilities.  Some of the tests overlap
with the various examples, and some are more specific.  The testing suite also
tests the C versions of functions where required.  When running CAPE in normal
circumstances, a failed call to a C method falls back to a Python method.
