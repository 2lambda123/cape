Cart3D Documentation for pyCart
*******************************

Some independent documentation for Cart3D is provided here; it is written from
the perspective of pyCart and Cape and closely follows the :mod:`pyCart` module.

Note the two following locations for stand-alone Cart3D documentation.  The
second link requires entering some basic information but is free.  These were
most recently accessed on April 19, 2016.

    * `<http://people.nas.nasa.gov/~aftosmis/cart3d/>`_
    * `<http://info.desktop.aero/cart3ddocs.html>`_

This documentation is really about the Cart3D input and output files and the
Cart3D binaries.  All or most of the content is discussed in the context of
pyCart and how the two software suites work together.  Many of the details are
made theoretically invisible to users of pyCart, but having a reference is
useful when problems or difficult scenarios arise.

The following table describes input files to Cart3D.

    +
    | File
    +
    | ``input.cntl``
    | ``Config.xml``
    | ``Components.i.tri``
    | ``preSpec.c3d.cntl``
