Examples Using pyCart
=====================

Example projects that demonstrate how to use pyCart can be found in
``$PYCART/examples/pycart/`` where ``$PYCART`` is the folder in which pyCart or
Cape is installed.  The examples are intended to roughly increase in capability
in an interactive fashion to initiate users to the various capabilities of
pyCart and Cart3D.
