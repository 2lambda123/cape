:mod:`cape.attdb.ftypes.csv`: Comma-separated value read/write
===============================================================

This module contains a basic interface in the spirit of
:mod:`cape.attdb.ftypes` for standard comma-separated value files.  It
creates a class, :class:`CSV` that does not rely on the popular
:func:`numpy.loadtxt` function.

If possible, the column names (which become keys in the
:class:`dict`-like class) are read from the header row.  If the file
begins with multiple comment lines, the column names are read from the
final comment before the beginning of data.
